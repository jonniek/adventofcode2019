## Advent of code 2019

My rust is a bit rusty. Solutions are in general not
optimizied/cleaned up for longer than a minute or two
after getting the correct answer. I tried to write
idiomatic rust but sometimes it was easier to write things
more imperatively.

Finished at 31 of december.

Running:
```
cd dayXX/
# create input file to input/input.txt
cat input/input.txt | cargo run
```

Except for day 25:
```
cd day25/
# create input file to input/input.txt
cargo run
# play the text adventure until you are at the
# locked door, then write 'bruteforce' to solve
# the item combination
```
